    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Banh mi is a Vietnamese dish, which originated under French rule, it's a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine, and very popular. You can use beef, or bologne or even pork floss instead and it'll still come out great!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup julienned (2-inch matchsticks) daikon radish</li>
        <li>1/4 cup julienned (2-inch matchsticks) carrots</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hoisin sauce, or to your taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sriracha hot sauce, or more to your taste</li>
        <li>1 crusty French sandwich roll/baguette</li>
        <li>4 ounces cooked pork roast, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 ounces smooth pate, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>6 thin spears English cucumber, diced</li>
        <li>6 thin slices jalapeno pepper, or more to your taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cilantro leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Line with a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Toss radish and carrot with seasoned rice vinegar in a bowl until well coated. Let sit until veggies become slightly limp, 15-20 minutes. Drain and set aside or refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise, hoisin sauce, and sriracha in a small bowl. Split French roll just enough so you can open it like a book. Pull out some of the bread from the top half to better accommodate the filling if desired. Spread the interior surfaces of roll liberally with mayonnaise mixture.</li>
        <li>Transfer roll, cut-side up, to the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until warm and crisp with slightly browned edges, about 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place sliced pork, paté, pickled radish and carrot, cucumber, jalapeño, and cilantro leaves in warm roll. Cut in half to serve.</li>
    </ol>
