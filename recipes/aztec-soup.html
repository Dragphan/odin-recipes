    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tomatoes</li>
        <li>150g of diced onion</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 chipotle chile in adobo, or 1 pasilla chile</li>
        <li>6 1/3 cups of water or chicken broth</li>
        <li>Olive oil or similar for frying foods</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of dried epazote, or better yet fresh epazote</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, and salt to your liking</li>
        <li>100 g. of asadero cheese, or queso fresco and sour cream</li>
        <li>4 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 avocado</li>
        <li>finely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the tomatoes, garlic and onion to fry in a pan until they're well cooked. It's best to use a non-stick frying pan with no oil, make sure you're flipping or moving the ingredients in order to get an even cook.</li>
        <li>When those are ready, put them in a blender, and add the water, garlic, black pepper, and salt; blend everything well together.</li>
        <li>In a pot add oil, and add the blended mix. Bring it to boil, and then add the chipotle, and water, then leave it on low flame for 12 minutes. Then add a teaspoon of dried epazote (or fresh if you have it). Stir it well, and let it boil for another minute.</li>
        <li>In the meanwhile cut the corn tortillas en julienne, and add them to a frying pan on low heat until they're golden colored, and crispy, while they do that cut the cheese and avocado.</li>
        <li>When serving, add a fistful of the fried cut tortilla strips in each bowl. Add and make sure there's enough soup for the tortillas to all get wet. Put a few more cut tortilla strips on top, along with the cheese, avocado, and a bit of the cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
