    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/3 cups water</li>
        <li>2/3 cup short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>1/2 pound imitation crabmeat, flaked</li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cucumber, peeled cut into small strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).</li>
        <li>Boil the water in a medium pot, and stir in the rice. Then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover it, and simmer until the rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 t0 25 minutes. Or use a rice cooker to prepare it.</li>
        <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a bowl, gently stir into the cooked rice in the pot and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Lay the nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat (lay a plastic film between the bamboo mat and the nori so that the rice doesn't get stuck in the bamboo mat). Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center.</li>
        <li>Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4-6 slices, depending on how wide you like your sushi.</li>
    </ol>
